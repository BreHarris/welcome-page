    <p className='Who am I?'>

            Hi! My name is Breanna Harris and I am a first year here at University of Colorado Boulder. I am a comp sci major with an interest in Robotics or Artifical Intelligence. 
        My hobbies include playing the guitar, crocheting, traveling, and just being around my friends. While I in school I hope to learn a lot about the computer science space and 
        narrow down the specific field that I am interested in. Depending on what it's like, I would love to have a job where I can work remotely after a couple of years so that way 
        I am able to travel the world and see everything that I want to see. 

            Besides my work interests I love traveling and being away from home. I was born in Canada and moved to Michigan when I was four years old where I grew up in the small town
        of Caledonia. I lived there my whole life even doing dual-enrollment to get some college credits before I decided that for my college experience I wanted to be somewhere else 
        which is why I decided to come out here to see new areas of the United States and be able to expand on my interests.
